                Welcome to <strong>[Your App Name]</strong> ("we", "our", "us"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information.
                This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.
            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-4">1. Information We Collect</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Information</strong>: Name, email address, phone number, identification (optional), organization — when you register or sign in.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: Log data, pages visited, timestamps, IP address, device/browser information.</li>
                <li><strong>Cookies & Similar Technologies</strong>: Cookies and local storage for session management and preferences.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5 class="mt-4">2. How We Use Your Information</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>To provide, operate, and maintain the application.</li>
                <li>To manage and authenticate users (logins, roles, permissions).</li>
                <li>To improve and personalize the user experience.</li>
                <li>To send important notifications (security alerts, updates, policy changes).</li>
                <li>For analytics and diagnostics to improve the service.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5 class="mt-4">3. Legal Basis for Processing (if applicable)</h5>
            <p>
                Where required, we rely on your consent, contractual necessity (to provide the service), or legitimate interests (security, fraud prevention, analytics).
            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-4">4. Cookies & Tracking</h5>
            <p>
                We use cookies for session management and preferences. You can control cookie settings in your browser. We may also use analytics cookies (e.g., Google Analytics) — refer to the third-party section below.
            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-4">5. Third-Party Services</h5>
            <p>
                We may share data with trusted third-party service providers who help operate the application (hosting providers, email services, analytics). These providers are obligated to process data only as we instruct and to maintain confidentiality.
            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-4">6. Data Retention</h5>
            <p>
                We retain personal information only as long as necessary to provide services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. Retention periods vary by data type.
            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-4">7. Security</h5>
            <p>
                We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect personal data. However, no system is 100% secure — if a breach occurs, we will follow legal requirements and notify affected users as required.
            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-4">8. Your Rights</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Access: You may request access to personal data we hold about you.</li>
                <li>Correction: You can request corrections to inaccurate data.</li>
                <li>Deletion: Where permitted by law, you may request deletion of your data.</li>
                <li>Objection / Restriction: You can object to or request restriction of certain processing activities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To exercise these rights, contact us using the details below. We may ask for identity verification before processing such requests.
            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-4">9. Children</h5>
            <p>
                Our service is not directed to children under 13 (or local age of consent). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child’s data was collected, contact us to remove it.
            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-4">10. Changes to This Policy</h5>
            <p>
                We may update this policy occasionally. When we do, we will revise the "Last updated" date and, where appropriate, notify users by email or in-app notice.
            </p>
